# ESP32-CAM Traffic Violation Detection System
Traffic Violation Detection System is a system that utilizes machine learning and embedded device to detect a traffic violation, especially on a traffic light. The system would/should notify the authorities if it detects an object inside the caution area.

this project is an Embedded System Final Project developed by **Group 18**

## Instalations
//dont forget to downgrade esp32 to version 1.0.4

## Known Issue/Bug
- Wifi SSID Configuration doesn't support space character (ssid that contain any space)
- Apple's Safari doesn't trigger the alarm when an object anchor passing the boundary (javascript related)
